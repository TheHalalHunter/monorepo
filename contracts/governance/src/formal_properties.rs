#![cfg(kani)]

//! Kani formal-verification harnesses for `governance`.
//!
//! Core security invariants under proof:
//!   1. **Proposal state-machine correctness** — proposals can only advance
//!      through legal transitions (Active → Passed/Rejected → Executed or
//!      Active → Cancelled).  No proposal may be executed without first
//!      being finalized as `Passed`.
//!   2. **Timelock enforcement** — `execute_proposal` is rejected before
//!      `voting_ends_at + TIMELOCK_SECS` has elapsed.
//!
//! Kani proofs are gated with `#[cfg(kani)]` and are NOT compiled or run by
//! `cargo test`.  They require `cargo kani` and are not a CI merge gate.
